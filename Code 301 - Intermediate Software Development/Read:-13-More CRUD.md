## CRUD Basics

- Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

To update a record through an API, the HTTP method that should be used is PUT or PATCH.

- Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

The REST methods that require an ID parameter are: GET (retrieve a specific resource), PUT or PATCH (update a specific resource), and DELETE (delete a specific resource).

- Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

The relationship between REST and CRUD is that CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a set of basic operations that can be performed on a resource, while REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of principles for designing networked applications that expose resources through a standardized interface. A RESTful API typically supports the CRUD operations for the resources it exposes.

- If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

The 5 steps for creating a RESTful API are:

1. Define the resources that the API will expose.
2. Determine the endpoints for each resource and the HTTP methods that will be used for each operation (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).
3. Design the data model and schema for each resource.
4. Implement the API endpoints and associated functionality, using an appropriate framework (such as Express for Node.js).
5. Test the API endpoints and make any necessary adjustments or bug fixes.
