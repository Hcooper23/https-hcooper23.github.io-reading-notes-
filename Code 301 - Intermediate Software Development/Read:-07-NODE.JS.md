- What is node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript. It provides an event-driven architecture that is designed to handle large amounts of I/O-intensive, scalable, and high-performance applications.

- In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is an open-source JavaScript engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser. It is written in C++ and compiles JavaScript code to machine code before executing it, resulting in faster performance than traditional JavaScript interpreters.

- What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node being a JavaScript runtime means that it allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side outside of the web browser, giving developers the ability to use JavaScript to build server-side applications.

- What is npm?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that allows developers to easily install, manage, and share his, her, their, etc. reusable Node..js packages or modules. It is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Engaged Collaboration has been the most interesting part of the pair programming, this has been amazing for me to utilize my skills and different backgrounds. To help with me developing on top of them or learning from others and seeing what I can help them learn and develop inside of there life.

- How does pair programming work?

Pair programming works by having two developers work together on computers. One person is the "driver," responsible for typing code and implementing the solution, while the other person is the "navigator," responsible for providing guidance, asking questions, and checking for errors. The two developers swap roles on a regular basis to ensure both are involved and contributing. This process allows for real-time collaboration and immediate feedback, leading to better overall code quality and more efficient development.
