## What is OAuth

- What is OAuth?

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation that allows a user to grant a third-party website or application access to their resources stored with a service provider, such as Facebook or Google, without sharing their login credentials.

- Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

An example of using OAuth is when a user logs in to a website or application using their Google or Facebook account. In this case, the website or application uses OAuth to ask the user for permission to access their account information stored with Google or Facebook. If the user grants permission, the website or application is issued an access token that it can use to access the user's information.

- How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

OAuth works by having the user authenticate with the service provider, which then issues an access token to the third-party application. The steps in the OAuth process are:

1. The user attempts to access a resource on the third-party application.
2. The third-party application redirects the user to the service provider for authentication.
3. The user enters their login credentials on the service provider's website.
4. The service provider authenticates the user and asks for their permission to grant access to the third-party application.
4. If the user grants permission, the service provider issues an access token to the third-party application.
5. The third-party application can then use the access token to access the user's information on the service provider.

- What is OpenID?

OpenID is an open standard that allows users to authenticate with multiple websites and applications using a single set of login credentials. OpenID works by having the user authenticate with an identity provider, which then issues an identity token that the user can use to authenticate with other websites and applications that support OpenID.

## Authorization and Authentication flows

- What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through a set of login credentials such as a username and password. Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining whether a user has the right to access a particular resource or function within a system.

- What is Authorization Code Flow?

The authorization code flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow for web server applications. It involves the exchange of an authorization code for an access token, which allows the application to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

- What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an enhanced version of the Authorization Code Flow that is designed to protect against certain types of attacks, such as code injection and man-in-the-middle attacks. It involves the use of a code verifier and a code challenge, which are used to verify the authenticity of the authorization code.

- What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

Implicit Flow with Form Post is an OAuth 2.0 flow that is used for single-page web applications. It involves the exchange of an access token directly with the authorization server, without the use of an intermediate authorization code.

- What is Client Credentials Flow?

Client Credentials Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow that is used for machine-to-machine authentication. It involves the exchange of a client ID and client secret for an access token, which allows the application to access protected resources on its own behalf.

- What is Device Authorization Flow?

The device authorization flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow for devices that don't have a browser or can't display a login screen. It involves the user authorizing the device through a separate device, such as a mobile phone or computer, and then entering a code into the device to complete the authorization process.

- What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

The Resource Owner Password Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow that allows users to provide their username and password directly to an application, which then exchanges them for an access token. This flow should only be used in certain situations, such as when no other flow is available or when the user fully trusts the application.
