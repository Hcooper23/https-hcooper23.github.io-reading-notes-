## How I explained REST to my brother

- Who is Roy Fielding? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

- Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

The techniques used in the class referred to in the linked GitHub Gist are likely focused on building applications that communicate with a specific set of machines or services, rather than being designed to communicate with any machine in the world. This is because communication across the entire internet requires a much more scalable and flexible approach, which is not typically covered in an introductory course.

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer data over the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

- What does a GET do? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

A GET request is an HTTP request used to retrieve information from a server. When a user types a URL into a browser, for example, a GET request is sent to the server, which responds with the requested web page or resource.

- What does a POST do? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

A POST request is an HTTP request used to send data to a server to be processed. This is often used when submitting a form on a web page, where the data entered by the user is sent to the server for processing.

- What does PUT do? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

PUT is an HTTP request used to update an existing resource on a server. For example, a user might use a PUT request to update their profile information on a social media site.

- What does PATCH do? [A Conversation about REST with my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

PATCH is an HTTP request used to make a partial update to an existing resource on a server. It is used when the client only wants to modify a portion of the resource, rather than replacing the entire thing.

## API Keys

Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
