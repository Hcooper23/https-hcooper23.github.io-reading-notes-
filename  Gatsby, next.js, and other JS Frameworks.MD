# Gatsby, next.js, and other JS Frameworks

Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) as a major feature, allowing you to pre-render React components on the server for faster initial page loads and improved SEO. It supports both Static Site Generation (SSG) and SSR as pre-rendering options. Next.js also offers automatic code splitting, breaking your JavaScript code into smaller chunks that are loaded as needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving performance. Additionally, Next.js includes optimized prefetching, intelligently preloading JavaScript and data required for upcoming navigation, resulting in faster page transitions for users. These features contribute to a better user experience and optimized performance in Next.js applications.

Gatsby.js is renowned for its static site generator capabilities, enabling the creation of optimized websites through the generation of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. By pulling data from various sources like Markdown files, APIs, CMSs, and databases, Gatsby.js can generate static pages that can be served globally, resulting in highly performant websites with excellent SEO capabilities. One of Gatsby.js's strengths lies in its robust plugin system, which allows developers to extend and customize its functionality using a wide range of community plugins. These plugins offer features such as data source integration, image optimization, SEO handling, and more, empowering developers to enhance their development workflow, improve site performance, and seamlessly integrate with third-party services for a flexible and customizable development experience.
