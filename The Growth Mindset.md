- What is the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset?

  - A fixed mindset refers to the belief that one's abilities and intelligence are fixed traits that cannot be changed significantly. Individuals with a fixed mindset tend to avoid challenges, fear failure, and view setbacks as indicators of their inherent limitations. In contrast, a growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through effort, practice, and learning. People with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in the face of obstacles, and see failures as opportunities for growth and improvement.

- How does mindset impact personal and professional development?
  - Mindset plays a big role in personal and professional development. Individuals with a growth mindset are more likely to embrace challenges, take risks, and persist in the face of setbacks. They have a greater willingness to engage in deliberate practice, seek feedback, and continuously learn and improve. This mindset fosters resilience, motivation, and a love for learning, leading to greater personal fulfillment and success in various domains.

Passion provides the initial drive and enthusiasm, while perseverance ensures continued dedication and resilience in the face of obstacles. Grit is essential for achieving long-term success and surpassing short-term fluctuations in motivation or circumstances.

## A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

- The topic of a kinder, gentler philosophy of success, as discussed in Alain de Botton's TED Talk, is relevant to my studies in this module. Understanding alternative perspectives on success and exploring the role of well-being, fulfillment, and balance in personal and professional endeavors is important for promoting a holistic approach to learning and achievement.

- What is a kinder, gentler philosophy of success?

  - A kinder, gentler philosophy of success challenges traditional notions of success that often prioritize external markers such as wealth, power, and prestige. It emphasizes the importance of personal well-being, emotional fulfillment, and meaningful connections in defining and pursuing success. It encourages people to consider their own values, desires, and individual paths to success, fostering a more compassionate and holistic approach to personal growth and achievement.

- How does this philosophy of success differ from conventional views?

  - This philosophy of success differs from conventional views by placing greater emphasis on subjective well-being, emotional resilience, and relationships. It recognizes that success is not solely measured by external achievements, but also by factors such as personal growth, contentment, and a sense of purpose. It challenges the idea that success is a one-size-fits-all concept and encourages people to define and pursue success on their own terms.

- Things I want to know more about:

  - How can people shift their mindset and adopt a kinder, gentler philosophy of success?
  - What are some examples of people or organizations that have embraced this philosophy of success and achieved positive outcomes?

## Measuring Emotional Intelligence

- I am utilizing these results to allow myself to grow in both a business, professional and personal life. In my views the ideas of constant improvement needs to continue throughout your life never stopping to determine why something failed or didn't work. If you have a disagreement with one another can you talk things out and understand someone else view point because this teaches you a critical skill on self-awareness which is something you can use in all aspects of life. Once you see and understand view points from all sides it allows you to grow and comprehend the information differently and ultimately allows for a-lot of self-growth and for advancements in all aspects of life.  

## Bias

- Based on the test I have some room for improvement but I see all things in life as a chance to improve on things. I had two areas that are my strongest Four Ways To Act and Effective Courage. I see these as very clear for me as I have been raised and formulated a clearly defined way to carry myself and avoid giving anyone a reason o question my actions. Then on behalf of effective courage, I am a self-caring but loving individual who will sacrifice myself for the safety of others. I had three that are my weaknesses Bias and Identity, Empathy and Curiosity, and Meaningful Connections. Now based on this I have intentions of working on my meaningful connections. After my time in service, I have lost that ability due to the loss of some friends and then some of the things I saw when I worked in law enforcement as well.
