# Reviewing topics that are familiar to you allows you to refresh yourself and understand the basics. Once you review a topic it is very possible that you learn even a new one. With the re-introduction of an old topic, you re-establish best practices and allow yourself to find flaws inside of your own work to help with growth

## HTML Advanced Text Formatting

**Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**

Why is Semantic HTML important? Writing semantic HTML makes your code easier to understand, and your source code more readable to other developers. Screen readers and browsers can interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible.

**How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**

Six Levels

**What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?**

A sup and sub-element both represent a superscript. These elements must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation for presentation's sake.

**When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**

Strict equality- test if two values are equal
Addition- adds two numbers together/ combines two strings
Subtraction, Multiplication, Division- same as basic math use ‘-‘=substraction, ‘*’=multiplication, ‘/‘=divison

**Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.**

Ordering groceries and getting multiple of the same item and using multiplication to allow for a price reflection based on the number of items requested.

## Making Decisions In Your Code – Conditionals

**An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.**

Expression, True

**What is the use of an else if?**

Specifying a new condition if the first condition is false.

**List 3 different types of comparison operators.** “<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals>"
=== and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
< and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another.
<= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

**What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?** “<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals>"

&& — AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
|| — OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
