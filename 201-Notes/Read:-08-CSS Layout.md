# Today's reading is introducing some new ways of seeing CSS and understanding how it can be done more effectively and the principles behind a new ideology of thinking for implementing this into my ways of coding

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**

Greater control over the alignment and spatial distribution between items in a container. Being one-dimensional, it only deals with the layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This idea works well for smaller layouts, such as components.

**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**

The horizontal axis is perpendicular to the main axis, so if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse, the horizontal axis runs down the column. If your main axis is column or column-reverse The horizontal axis then runs along the rows.

**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?** [Flexbox](https://www.scaler.com/topics/css/css-grid-vs-flexbox/)

Most major browsers support these, but they are still relatively new compared to the traditional box model. Flexbox may be simple, but more complex flexbox layouts can get complicated real quick. Complicated layouts are also quite messy to debug.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

**What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**

Instead of using floats to create layouts by floating elements to the left or right, Flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis.

## How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

It allowed me to understand a new concept that can be used to allow me to be more efficient and prevent long buildouts that are complicated to follow and understand.
