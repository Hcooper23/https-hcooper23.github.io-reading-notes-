The best example will be designing a page for a charity that is in support of the Special Olympics because you can have an idea that possibly some of your target audience will be visually impaired or unable to see an image, therefore you replace the image with a description in the text to read option will be able to read the test for the individual.

**How can you improve the accessibility of images in an HTML document?**

Use alternative text so you have a text alternative to the image. Avoid text in images. With images being accessible, you will have better interaction with the end user who may use screen readers, speech input software, speech-enabled websites, and mobile users, and it helps with SEO’S.

**Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**

GIF, like other image formats, is resolution-independent, so it will look pixelated when zoomed in or viewed at a higher resolution. SVG is scalable and resolution-independent and looks crisp and clear at any screen resolution.

So if you can imagine an old newspaper with the granulated pictures you would see and then imagine the picture you see today of your grandkids on the modern phones where if you zoom in on let's say your grandchild’s son you can see all the details versus the old photos you could barely tell the number of buttons on a short.

PNG because it typically would not be a huge amount of color data.

**Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

Based on the color scheme he wants I would recommend having three different background colors one for the header/ title, one for the body with a slight transparency for the text to pop and add some depth to it, this is for the footer to help draw eyes to it at the bottom of the page so once the user has scrolled through the page to allow for recognition of who has done the work and create the blog. 

**What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

Branding. A font you select should embody the character and spirit of your brand. You should look at what kind of font family you are using and minion such family throughout the page or if needing a change stay in the same family but a different variety of that family.  Limit your number o fonts too many become confusing and look unprofessional.
