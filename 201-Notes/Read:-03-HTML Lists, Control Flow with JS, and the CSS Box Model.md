## Ordered and Unordered lists

**When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

List related items but have no particular order

**How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

List-style-image- allows you to use a custom image for the bullet style
List-style-type- sets a marker of a list element

**When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?**

Unordered lists are used when you want to create a list of items in no particular order. The items in this list will be marked with bullets typically unless you modify the character. However, an ordered list is used to create a list of items in a specific order.

**Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

You can use ol type=“I” which will utilize lowercase roman numbers.

You can use ol type=“A” which will utilize uppercase letters.

## The Box Model

**Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

Margin is the outer layer that is wrapping the content, padding, and border with whitespace between the box and other elements.
Padding sits around content but is incased in the margin layer.

**List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model?**

- Margin is the outer layer that is wrapping the content, padding, and border.
- Border wraps content and padding. 
- Padding sits around content but is encased in the margin layer and border layer.
- Content this is the area where content is displayed and the most inner box/ area.

## Arrays, Operators and Expressions, Conditionals, Loops

**What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

You can have the following data types inside of an  Array: numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, objects, and list-like objects. Once defined all elements must be of the same type. 

**Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**

**List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do?**

- Assignment operators 
	Addition assignment x += f()
- Adds the value of a variable 
	Multiplication assignment x *= f()
- Multiples a variable 
	Reminder assignment x %= f()
- Divides the value of a variable
	Logical AND assignments x &&= f()
- Assigns if x is truthy
	Division assignment x /= f()

**Divides the value of a variable Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why?**

let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this 
(a + c) + b;

Not a valid code and did not result in any response.

**Describe a real-world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

A number of cookies left inside of the cookie jar and when to re-order more. 

**Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**

When you are attempting to repeat something over and over again but with slight modifications to the code 

## Things I want to know more about

Why are there two different short-hand methods for dividing?
