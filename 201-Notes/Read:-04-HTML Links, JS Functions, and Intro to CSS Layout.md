# The topics outlined in this reading allow us to understand best practice for linking a external source and how to avoid having a huge HTML just floating around on a page as a distraction for the end user. Also allowed us to understand some of the key things we need to succeeded once we complete the program.

## Creating Hyperlinks

**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

< a > but with no space between the a.

**The href attribute contains what information?**

This specifies the location of the external source

**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

Use clear wording, use features to link colored text to allow a reader to visually see the hyperlink clearly, and have hit stand out from the rest of the text. Use keywords instead of the whole link for the reader.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

**What is meant by “normal flow”?**

The standard way block or inline elements will display on the page before any alterations are made to the layout.

**What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**

Block level begins on a new line, as well they cover spaces from left to right as far as they can go.

Inline elements do not, they are bounded by the HTML element they are in.

**___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

Static Positioning

**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

Absolute positioning allows developers to precisely control the position of elements on a web page. This can be useful for creating complex, multi-layered layouts, and for positioning elements in specific locations on the page.
Absolute positioning is that it allows an element to be positioned independently of its parent, which makes it easier to create complex layouts and avoid conflicts with other elements on the page.

**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

Absolutely positioned elements are positioned relative to the containing block, which is the nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

## Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in a function expression to create an anonymous function.

**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

The values that get declared within a function are known as arguments.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

Work Environment Readiness: I believe this will help with my journey in coding due to the keywords already familiar due to my time here at code fellows. When a company has to spend less time training an employee it becomes a more profitable employee due to there ability to provide working systems, projects, or team integration when they are hired.

Social Skills: I believe the different people you meet allow youth to grow and learn, rather you are learning different viewpoints for work, social life, or even a complex issue inside of someone's life. It can let you grow and ultimately become better individuals.
