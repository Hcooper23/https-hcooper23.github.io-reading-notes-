## Growth midset 
Growth Mindset to me is the ability to accept feedback and allow yourself to process the words and feeling associated with this feedback. Following that up with structured plans and goals to achieve a goal that was determined from the growth you are attempting to achieve. Once the plans and goals have been determined process your timeline and remember perfection is not what you are after but the effort set forth on the journey is the achievement we all strive towards. 

1. Time (Remember its only with time can you grow and begin to understand concepts)

2. Patience (Never stop growing and learning or you will become stagnate and slowly become content with your surroundings)

3. Accepting (Be accepting of your growth and know you are attempting to achieve a better goal than yesterday)
