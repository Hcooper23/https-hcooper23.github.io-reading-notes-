## Introduction to SQL

- A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns.

    - It follows the relational model, which emphasizes the relationships and connections between tables.

    - Tables are structured with columns representing different attributes or fields, and rows representing individual records or instances.

    - Relational databases use keys to set up relationships between tables, such as primary keys and foreign keys.

    - They provide a structured and efficient way to store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data.

- SQL is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.

    - It provides a standardized way to interact with databases and perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

    - SQL allows users to define the structure of the database, create and modify tables, and set up relationships between them.

    - With SQL, users can retrieve data using SELECT statements, filter results with WHERE clauses, and sort data with ORDER BY.

- In summary, relational databases are a type of database that organize data into tables, following the relational model. SQL, as a programming language, provides a standardized way to interact with relational databases, enabling users to perform various operations and manipulate data effectively.
