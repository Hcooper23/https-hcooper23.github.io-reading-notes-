A CSS transition allows the developer to specify how an element should gradually change its style over a period of time when a specific property is changed. It creates an animation effect by smoothly transitioning an element from one state to another.
The transition can be defined for various CSS properties such as color, background-color, width, height, opacity, and many others. The developer can control the duration of the transition, the timing function (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, etc.), and other animation properties such as delay, iteration count, direction, and fill mode.
Using CSS transitions, developers can create more engaging and interactive user interfaces by providing visual feedback to the user when an element changes its state. For example, when the user hovers over a button, its background color can transition smoothly from one color to another, giving the user a sense of interaction with the website.

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

CSS animations and transitions are both used to create visual effects in web pages, but they differ in their approach and purpose.
A CSS transition is used to smoothly change the state of an element from one state to another. It is triggered by a CSS property change and allows you to animate the transition between the old and new state of the element. The transition effect occurs over a specified duration and timing function.
On the other hand, a CSS animation is a more complex way to animate an element. It allows you to create more dynamic and complex animations that are not tied to specific property changes. Animations typically involve a series of keyframes, which specify how an element should appear at different times during the animation. CSS animations can have an infinite loop or a specific number of iterations.
In short, a CSS transition is used for simple state transitions, whereas a CSS animation is used for more complex and dynamic animations.
