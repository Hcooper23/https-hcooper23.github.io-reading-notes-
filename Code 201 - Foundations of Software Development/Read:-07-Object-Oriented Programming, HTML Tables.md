# The ideas proposed inside of this reading help with introducing models or principles that are practices that will help us find new ways to interpolate data. It also allows us to get introduced to tables and understand the concepts of this new method of thinking

## Domain Modeling

**Explain why we need domain modeling.**
Implement the common language and underlying structures that are important for a feature and epic analysis.

## HTML Table Basics

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**
They are trying to build a web where content and structure are completely separated from presentation.

**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.**

[Semantics](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/html-semantics)

- Section: This defines a section in a web page.
- Article: This element contains the main part, containing information about the web page.
- Aside: The aside content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
- Footer: It defines a footer for a document or a section.

## Introducing Constructors

**What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**

[Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:
create a new object
bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
run the code in the constructor
return the new object.
Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create.

**How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**

[Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

It binds this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

**Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**

NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

A prototype is a mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit properties from each other. An inheritance is a way to create hierarchies between classes by inheriting from other classes.
Taking a product that is malfunctioning or needs updates to allow for future growth/ improvements. You take some inherited characteristics or ideas from the original product to allow for improvements that will keep the product from becoming outdated. As well you refer to the classes as competitorsâ€™ products and this allows you to simply adjust and alter the ideas or concepts from that product to help improve your idea or provide a possible solution.
