- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

    - Utilize my fellow classmates or collages to help with the continual learning inside of the tech industry. 
    - Work through it with simple solutions such as spelling, syntax, and order of items listed.
