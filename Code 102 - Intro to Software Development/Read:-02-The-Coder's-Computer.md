**What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**

A text editor is used to maximize code editing/usage efficiency. Because of the human error associated with coding, the use of a text editor will allow for maximum feedback and productivity. Commonly used in text editors will provide insight into common errors and, where possible, simple solutions. Once you are familiar with the problems you see, you can improve your skills by simply using the editor, and you can create maximum efficiency by eliminating searching for problems in various lines of code.

**What do the following commands do?**

  1. pwd “Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.”
  
  2. ls “List the contents of a directory.”
  
  3. cd “Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.”
  
  4. mkdir “Creates a directory or subdirectory.”
  
  5. touch “updates the access and modification times of each file specified by the File parameter of each directory specified by the Directory parameter”

**Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)**

1. cd projects - change directory to folder projects

2. mkdir new-project - make a new directory and create a folder named new-project

3. touch new-project/newfile.md - create a new file

4. cd .. makes the directory go back one level

5. ls projects/new-project - display the list of folder in projects/new-project
