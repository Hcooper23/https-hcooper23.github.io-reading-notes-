**What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?**

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When the event occurs (when the user clicks the button) - when it is invoked (invoked) by the JavaScript code - automatically (self-invoked)

Execute the named function instead of just referencing the function.
