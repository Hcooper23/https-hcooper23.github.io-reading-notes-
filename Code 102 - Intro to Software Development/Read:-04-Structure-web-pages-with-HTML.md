# Read: 04 Structure Web Pages With HTML

**What is HTML and why do we use it?**

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code used to build web pages and there content. Used to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**

- The opening tag: consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This indicates where the element begins or begins to take effect—in this case, where the paragraph begins.
- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This indicates where the element ends - in this case, where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard mistakes of beginners and can lead to strange results.
- The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**

**What is a semantic element?**
