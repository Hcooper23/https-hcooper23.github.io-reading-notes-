## Read: 08 Operators And Loops ##

**What is an expression in JavaScript?**
An expression is a block of code that evaluates to a value. A statement is any block of code that is performing some action. The distinction between an expression and a statement is important because an expression is a subset of a statement.

**Why would we use a loop in our code?**

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

**When does a for loop stop executing?**

Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

- When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement.

- When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement.

**How many times will a while loop execute?**

There is no fixed answer to how many times the while loop is executed. The while loop is always executed when there is a carry bit from one position to another.
