# Read: 05 Design Web Pages With CSS

**What is the purpose of CSS?**

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create beautiful web pages. This language allows for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.

**What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

- Inline: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

- Internal: An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

- External: External style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

**Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text**

'<P>{color: red; font-size: 5em;}</P>'
