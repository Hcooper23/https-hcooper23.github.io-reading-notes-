- How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node.js can be described as a platform that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a way to execute JavaScript on servers or computers as stand-alone applications. It essentially takes JavaScript, which is traditionally associated with web browsers, and enables it to run on servers or in other non-browser environments.

- What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

When we say that Node is a JavaScript runtime, it means that it provides an environment in which JavaScript code can be executed. It includes the necessary components and tools to interpret and run JavaScript code. Instead of being executed by a web browser, JavaScript code can be executed by the Node.js runtime environment.

- What is Node used for?

Node is used for a wide range of purposes in web development and server-side programming. Some common use cases for Node.js include building web servers, creating command-line tools and scripts, developing real-time applications (such as chat applications or collaborative tools), building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for client-server communication, and even creating desktop applications. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it well-suited for handling concurrent connections and building scalable network applications. It also benefits from a vast ecosystem of libraries and packages that developers can leverage to build their applications more efficiently.
